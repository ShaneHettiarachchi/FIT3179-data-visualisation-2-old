This stacked bar chart highlights the relationship between burn type and forest category across Victoriaâ€™s landscapes. It visually compares how much of each forest type experienced planned burns, unplanned burns, or remained unburnt. By stacking the bars, we can easily see the proportion of each burn type within every forest category, revealing key differences in fire management and exposure. For example, native forests may show higher rates of unplanned burns, while commercial plantations could have more planned fire activity. This visualization provides a clear overview of how various landscapes interact with fire, helping identify patterns for future land management.
