Bushfires are a recurring natural hazard in Victoria, impacting both the environment and communities. Each year, dry conditions and high temperatures increase the likelihood of fires igniting and spreading rapidly. Forested areas, particularly those with dense vegetation, are most vulnerable, while grasslands can carry flames across the landscape at high speed. Bushfires threaten wildlife habitats, destroy vegetation, and release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Fire management strategies include controlled burns, community education, and rapid emergency response. Understanding the patterns and causes of bushfires is essential for protecting lives, property, and biodiversity in the region.
